I am a researcher, previously at King's College London and the Oxford Internet Institute. My research focusses on contemporary British political history, in particular the Prime Ministers' Office, politics in digital spaces, and the House of Commons, seeking to understand how these institutions have adapted to the challenges posed by the contemporary era.

I graduated from the University of Buckingham with a BA in PPE, followed by Oxford with an MSc in Social Data Science, then King's College London with an MA in Political Economy. 

If you have any questions or want to contact me, please do get in touch.
